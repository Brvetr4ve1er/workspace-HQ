# Handoff log — frontend ⇄ structure

Append-only, **newest entry on top**. Entry format (keep it under ~15 lines):

```
## <date> <time> · FROM <lane> · <branch> @ <short-sha>
DONE: what landed (commits)
IN-FLIGHT: what's half-done / uncommitted
ASKS: what I need from the other lane
BREAKS: anything that changes the other lane's world (contract, files, hotkeys)
```

## 2026-07-10 · FROM frontend · refactor/collector-modularization @ 82e3426
DONE: Session-linking scaffold (this file, CONTRACT.md, root CLAUDE.md). Prior
  frontend work all committed: organic-UI shard engine (0d1ead9), UX declutter
  (29df117), theme system + fixes, spellbook UI integration.
IN-FLIGHT: nothing uncommitted in dashboard/. New frontend subproject starts
  next frontend session — scope TBD by user.
ASKS: (1) When modularization tasks land, keep `latest.json` shape identical —
  golden fixtures are the contract. (2) If you rename/move any collector output
  file (latest.json, spellbook.json, spell-telemetry.json, weekly-recap.json),
  announce in CONTRACT.md first: build-data.mjs + main.js read them by path.
  (3) Merge to main when the refactor is green; frontend commits are riding
  your branch (shared working tree).
BREAKS: none for you. FYI: main.js grew an ORGANIC UI section (shards) +
  `Ctrl+Alt+G` global hotkey + `data/shards.json` runtime file (gitignored-eligible,
  currently untracked-by-design? it IS written at runtime — treat as runtime state,
  don't schema-validate it).

# Data contract — collector (producer) ⇄ dashboard (consumer)

The frontend reads these files **by exact path and shape**. Changing anything here
requires an entry in the *Pending changes* section below BEFORE the code change,
plus a matching golden-fixture update in `collector/lib/__fixtures__/`.

## Files the frontend consumes

| File | Consumed by | Notes |
|---|---|---|
| `data/latest.json` | `build-data.mjs` → `window.DATA.latest` + `main.js` (tray, mini-HUD, shards, quest IPC) | the character sheet |
| `VEEMO CORTEX/…/Workspace Status *.json` | `build-data.mjs` → `window.DATA.scans[]` | time-machine history |
| `data/spellbook.json` | `build-data.mjs` → `window.DATA.spellbook` | arsenal |
| `data/spell-telemetry.json` | `build-data.mjs` → `window.DATA.telemetry` | mastery pips, collection meter |
| `data/weekly-recap.json` | `build-data.mjs` → `window.DATA.weeklyRecap` | Weekly Saga card |
| `data/quest-overrides.json` | written by `main.js` (quest-done, Obsidian sync), read by `assemble.mjs` | two-way |
| `data/brain-dump.json` | written by capture window, read by `assemble.mjs` | routed to side-quests |
| `data/shards.json` | runtime state of organic-UI shards — **main.js only**, not part of the scan | don't validate |

## Load-bearing fields in `latest.json` (renderer will crash/blank without these)

- `scan.{id, previous_scan, enriched}`
- `account.{level, title, xp, xp_into_level, xp_to_next, health_index, health_delta}`
- `account.streak.{scan_days, longest_scan_days, last_scan}`
- `account.totals.{products, open_quests, red_quests, achievements_unlocked, open_side_quests, learnings, knowledge_xp, archived}`
- `account.daily_top3[] {kind, label, reason, project_id, quest_id}`
- `account.spellcraft.{spell_of_day{id,name,icon,school,rarity,bonus_xp}, ever_cast, spells_known, ever_cast_pct, lifetime_casts, per_school}`
- `projects[] {id, name, path, stack, dev_cmd, canonical_branch, completion{pct,basis,delta}, level, xp,`
  `activity{state, days_since_commit, last_commit}, signals{has_readme,has_tests,has_ci,…},`
  `metrics{code_health{build,tests,files,loc,recent_files}, git_safety{…, last_commit_subject}, risk_security{…}},`
  `insights, suggestions, roadmap, side_quests[]}`
- `quests[] {id, title, tier, xp, status, age_days, insight, project_id, completed}`
  — **quest `id` format `q-<project>-<concern>` is load-bearing**: Obsidian two-way
  sync round-trips it via `🆔` markers in Quest Board.md and `wq:` tasks in dailies.
- `side_quests[] {id (sq-…), kind, severity, title, detail, project_id, project_name, effort, impact, source, fat_dirs?}`
- `achievements[] {id, unlocked, unlocked_on?, progress{have,need}?}`
- `trends.{health_index, xp, knowledge_xp, completion_by_project, open_quests_by_tier, git_risk}` (arrays of `{d,v}`)
- `changes_since_prev[] {type, detail, impact, notify, …}` — celebration takeover keys on
  types `level_up`, `new_achievement`, `quest_completed`
- `inventory.{vaults, clones, anomalies, duplicates, empty, trivial}` + `archived_projects[]`, `recent_learnings[]`
